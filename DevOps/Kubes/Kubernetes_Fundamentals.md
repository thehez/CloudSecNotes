## What is Kubernetes
TL;DR - Kubernetes, known as Kubes or 'k8s', is an open-source container orchestration tool for managing container workloads at scale.

Kubernetes, created by Google, is an open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. 

Containers provide an lightweight platform to bundle applications and microservices. In a production environment, a container orchestration tool, such as k8s, provides a framework to run distributed systems resiliently by handling the managent of container deployments and workloads. For example, if a container dies, kubernetes will automatically schedule another container to replace it, minimising downtime and reducing the operational overhead on system administrators.
