This repository serves as a collection of personal notes, lessons and cheatsheets for auditing and securing cloud environments that may be useful to other security professionals. It should go without saying (except it won't so I am saying) that any offensive techniques (TTPs) outlined within should not be used on assets and environments you don't own or have permission to access.

Additionally I don't take full ownership for the information contained within, in a lot of ways I have just pooled various resources, blogs, tools etc into one coherent resource that I can quickly access.
